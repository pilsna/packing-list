# The Open Source Packing List

It's in 
[Github Task List flavored](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)
markdown and 
[MIT Licensed](http://kvz.io/licenses/LICENSE-MIT), 
so pretty easy to fork & personalise for your next trip.

It list has evolved over the years and is **suited for city trips, conferences and <=10 day holidays**.

I'm open sourcing this so you too can enjoy efficient packing and
the peace of mind that comes with that : )

If you miss anything, fork it.  
If you think others will miss it too, send a pull request!
